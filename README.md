# RPG-Database
A working database to save your RPG characters to

In order to get the program working (on windows) you need to install javafx and you need to run the following command: 
@echo off
javaw --module-path "Replace\With\Path\To\JavaFX\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar %*

or the following command if you are using a linux machine:
java -jar --module-path "Replace\With\Path\To\JavaFX\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

After running the command the program will boot up and you can get started on creating your character!

*Please note that the Race does not currently work correctly!
